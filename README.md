🚀 Project Showcase: Next Word Predictor Using LSTM

I’m excited to share my recent Deep Learning project, where I built a Next Word Prediction system using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks) — a core technique behind intelligent text and language models.

🔹 Project Overview
The goal of this project was to predict the most probable next word in a sentence based on previous context. By leveraging LSTM’s ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, the model learns linguistic patterns from text data and generates meaningful predictions.

🔹 Key Features
✅ Text preprocessing: tokenization, sequence generation, and padding
✅ Implemented LSTM-based neural network for sequence modeling
✅ Trained the model on large text data to capture contextual patterns
✅ Evaluated predictions for accuracy and contextual relevance

🔹 Tech Stack Used
🔸 Programming Language: Python
🔸 Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow / Keras
🔸 Libraries: NumPy, Pandas
🔸 Environment: Jupyter Notebook

🔹 Core Learnings
📌 How LSTM handles long-term dependencies in text sequences
📌 Importance of data preprocessing in NLP tasks
📌 Sequence modeling and embedding representations
📌 Training, tuning, and evaluating deep learning models

This project strengthened my understanding of NLP, Deep Learning, and sequence modeling, and gave me hands-on experience with real-world text prediction systems.

I’m actively exploring more projects in Deep Learning, NLP, and Generative AI 🚀
Feedback, suggestions, and collaboration opportunities are always welcome!
